Learned wireshark and nmap
So for Nmap: 
I started it by downloading it from offical website
then i opened cmd in my windows laptop 
searched ipconfig got my ip address
put the ip address in nmap and scanned used the command nmap -sS 192.168.x.xxx
then i used the tcp ports i got to scan in wireshark 
then saved all the open ports
